Glowing so brightly! \n A deep forest light captured me tightly \n Entranced by the beauty, by the radiance, \n She was such a cutie, with such pleasance! \n\n How lucky can i be? \n With her face so pretty?! \n Her eyes like the sun, \n And she looks oh so fun! \n\n Oh gosh, to reminisce in such bliss, \n A truly special moment in time, \n Lost inside a sweet, dark abyss, \n For she is so profoundly sublime.",

The second onee is abyss idkk i wanted to make it soundd like mysteriouss and stuff and i thought the first stranza of the poemm fits kindaa like the theme of made in abyss?

                "Riham :\n\nWhen I think of the quiet that comes with the rain, \n I see your name etched on my windowpane, \n A gentle drizzle, a soft, steady stream, \n That flows through the center of every dream. \n\n When I see the brilliance that comes with the sun, \n I remember the splendor of your ravishing eyes, \n Your gorgeous hair, that charming yellow dress, \n I remember a gleeful torrent, that leaves me jubilated. \n\n When I walk through the green of a deep, silent wood, \n I feel your spirit in the roots where I’ve stood. \n Every leaf holds a droplet, a secret you’ve told, \n I feel a peaceful mist, one that makes me safe. \n\n You’ve built a home inside my restless head, \n Walking through my thoughts with a velvet tread. \n Four walls of you, surrounding every view, \n There is no 'me' that isn't drenched in 'you'.",
                "OKAYYYY THIS ONE IS MORE COMPLICATEDD. Everytime the words mentioning rain, it's about you (drizzle, torrent, mist, etc...). The 'scenery' is happening basically in my head. Like for example 'I see your name etched on my windowpane' the windowpane is not a real windowpane, it's referencing to my mind/eyes. Same kind of symbolism with the leaf, droplet, and the woods. Both meanings can be interpreted as in yes when I walk through the woods I think about you but also this woods is part of how I imagine you, how I see you in my mind. It's basically kind of a follow up on the first poem, and I guess all of them are related in some way. It's like 3 things in nature that remind me of you alott and I tried to pick out like attributes about them and about you that are similar yknoww? The last stranza is the one that is different but it's like a recap of the three, a finisher of sorts. This poem is more about wordplay, not that muchh rhyming only for the first and last kinda? OHHHH btw the 2nd stranza line 2 and 3 last words is 'eyes' 'dress' (yknowwwwwwww like the singer that made jealous, something about you, that guyyy). Ummm I thinkk thats all i have to sayy? I was happyyy with this one it was a bit more seriouss and like less childishh like the first onee? 😭 Tho i kinda like how simplee the first one iss"

            ["Thank You :\n\nA soft percussion on a drying meadow, \n Refreshing and delightful, not a falsetto, \n Not quite a storm, but a serene rain, \n That hums beneath the surface of the grain. \n\n After the drizzle, a rainbow follows, \n Feeling grateful, delighted, filled with eau, \n It thanks the rain for this alluring show, \n For leaves will blow and fauna shall grow! \n\n A silent strength takes root within the deep, \n Now flourishing into a valley of flowers, \n Learning the knowledge that the seasons keep, \n Refining it's soul through the quiet hours. \n\n The tangled boughs reach out to touch the sky, \n On this steady rain, the roots rely, \n A forest born where once was only dust, \n Built on the rhythm of a constant trust. \n\n Thank you.",
             "This one is very sensitive for me. \n  For all of these poems I had an idea in mind of the general theme I wanted to talk about, but they've all kind of formed their own selves in a way? I don't really want to explain this one 😭 Even if I were to I think I wouldn't do a good job. It also just makes me feel like superr sensitive or whatever idkk the word for it. I think it's probably my favorite out of them all. Sorryy for not being able to explain 😭"],
            ["A Promise : \n\nAn ebb and flow of rain and sun, \n An uncontrollable balance of nature's whim, \n A perfection in chaos, where the threads are spun, \n Distorted only by the lens one is looking in. \n\n When the wind blows, it carries her scent, \n A breath that encompasses all that is hers, \n Intoxicating, invigorating, and refreshing, \n A soul deep thirst that is finally quenching. \n\n  Four horizons calling, under golden skies, \n Led by the light that I find in your eyes. \n Through the unknown, where the wildness lies, \n A love that adapts, but never dies. \n\n So let the clouds gather and the seasons turn, \n For every new lesson, together we'll learn, \n A life long Riham, for which I will always yearn, \n To the center of us, I'll always return.",
             "I really like this one too! Honestly throughout all of these poems I've grown more and more comfortable with expressing myself in this way. I usually only wrote poems when like I had a crazy amount of inspiration and it basically would write itself you know? Like that poemm that I made for youu beforee idkk if you rememberr 'it was raining today and i thought about you.'. I'm kinda yapping and not explaining it 😭😭 Okayy well to be honest I don't have muchhh to sayy. The 2nd stranza is kind of out of place but I actually started with that onee. Um I mean i don't think anything is too complicatedd or anythingg? Idkk what to explain 😭"]
